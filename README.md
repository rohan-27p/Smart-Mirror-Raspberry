Smart_Mirror 🚀
A real-time Emotion Detection System built for Raspberry Pi, PC, and Colab!

💡 What It Does
Smart_Mirror uses your webcam to detect facial emotions like happy, sad, angry, and more—all in real-time.
It then responds with context-aware, voice-based compliments using pyttsx3, creating an uplifting and interactive experience every time you look at it.

Your emotions are yours.
Smart_Mirror is fully offline, ensuring zero data transmission or storage. Everything is processed locally, making it 100% privacy-respecting.
